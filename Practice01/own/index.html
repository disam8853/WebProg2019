        There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For <br>
        instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <i>important</i>, italicc, emphasized, <small>small...</small> <br>
        <mark>the</mark> list goes on and on.
        <br><br>
        You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
        <blockquote>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
            time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
            we seek.</blockquote>
        not to mention how easy commenting is in html

        <h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
        <div>
            A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line
            and take up the full width available.
        </div>
        <span>
            And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
        </span>
