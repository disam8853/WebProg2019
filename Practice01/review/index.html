    <h1>This is a Heading (h1)</h1>
    <h2>This is a Heading too! (h2)</h2>
    <h3>This is also a Heading! (h3)</h3>

    <p>This is a paragraph (p). Line breaks here: <br>
        and continues...</p>

    <p>There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
        instance you can make words <b>bold</b>,<strong>important</strong>,<i>italicc</i>,<em>emphasized</em>,<small>small</small>...
        the <del>list</del> <ins>goes</ins> <sub>on</sub> and <sup>on</sup>.</p>

    <p>You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:</p>
    <blockquote>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
        time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
        we seek.</blockquote>

    <h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>

    <div>A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line
        and take up the full width available.</div>

    <span>And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</span>

    <h1>Now head over to the version with css and see how powerful css is!</h1>
