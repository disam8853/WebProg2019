      There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
      instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>...
      <mark>the</mark> <del>list</del> <ins>goes</ins> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
      <blockquote id="Quote">
        Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
        time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
        we seek.
      </blockquote>
      <!--not to mention how easy commenting is in html-->

      <h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
      <div>
        A &#60 div &#62 is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
        and take up the full width available.
      </div>
      <br />
      <span>
        And a &#60 span &#62 tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
      </span>
